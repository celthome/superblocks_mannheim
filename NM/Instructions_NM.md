# Instructions to NoiseModelling (NM)

First, data for the AoI must be downloaded via BBBike.

Next, the NM was conducted on a local instance as described here: https://noisemodelling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Noise_Map_From_OSM_Tutorial.html

To simulate individual scenarios, the data was manipulated locally, and then the NM was rerun for each scenario.

The results were visualized using QGIS.
