# Instructions to NoiseModelling (NM)

The NM was conducted on a local instance as described here: https://noisemodelling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Noise_Map_From_OSM_Tutorial.html

To simulate individual scenarios, the data was manipulated locally, and then the NM was rerun for each scenario.

To visualize the difference in noise levels, the previously described steps were repeated using 1dB steps.

The results (repo-folder: output/nm) were visualized using QGIS.
